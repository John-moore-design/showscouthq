```
[First Name],

Concert tickets are expensive. But they don't have to be.

Here are 5 strategies I use to save $50+ on every show:

1. **Compare Multiple Sites**
   Prices vary by $20-50 between sites. I always check:
   - [Affiliate link 1]
   - [Affiliate link 2]
   - [Affiliate link 3]

2. **Buy Early (or Very Late)**
   Best seats go first, but last-minute deals happen.

3. **Avoid Fees**
   [Strategy]

4. **Use Presale Codes**
   [Where to find them]

5. **Check Resale Sites**
   Sometimes cheaper than face value.
