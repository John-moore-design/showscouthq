            <li>We compare multiple ticket sources to help you find the best deals</li>
            <li>We provide genuine value through detailed venue guides and concert insights</li>

          <p>
            When you click an affiliate link on our site, a cookie is placed in your browser. 
            If you purchase tickets within the cookie duration (typically 30-45 days), we 
            receive a commission.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> You pay the same price whether you use our links or 
            go directly to the ticket site. The commission comes from the ticket marketplace, 
            not from you.
