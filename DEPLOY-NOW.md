# ðŸš€ DEPLOY NOW - Get Your Site Live in 15 Minutes

## Step 1: Initialize Git (2 minutes)

Open terminal and run these commands:

```bash
cd /Users/johnmoore/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Media-Assets/income

## Step 2: Create GitHub Repository (3 minutes)

### Option A: Using GitHub Website
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `showscouthq`
3. Description: "Ticket affiliate website for country and pop concerts"
4. Keep it **Private** (for now)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

### Option B: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)
```bash
gh repo create showscouthq --private --source=. --remote=origin
```

---

## Step 3: Push to GitHub (2 minutes)

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Run:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/showscouthq.git

# Push code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Your code is now on GitHub!** âœ…

## Step 4: Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)

2. Sign up with GitHub (easiest)
3. Authorize Vercel to access your repos

### B. Import Project

2. Select your `showscouthq` repository
3. Vercel will auto-detect Next.js settings âœ…

### C. Configure Environment Variables
Click "Environment Variables" and add:

```bash
# Leave these empty for now - add later when you have keys
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVERTKIT_FORM_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=
TICKET_NETWORK_AFFILIATE_ID=
VIVID_SEATS_AFFILIATE_ID=
STUBHUB_AFFILIATE_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=
```

**Note:** You can add these later. The site will work without them.

### D. Deploy
1. Click "Deploy"
2. Wait 2-3 minutes
3. Click the deployment URL

**Your site is LIVE!** ðŸŽ‰

You'll get a URL like: `https://showscouthq.vercel.app`

## Step 5: Add Custom Domain (Optional - 5 minutes)

### A. Register Domain
If you haven't already:
- Go to Namecheap, Google Domains, or Cloudflare

- Cost: ~$12/year

### B. Connect to Vercel
1. In Vercel dashboard, go to your project
2. Click "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
3. Add your domain: `showscouthq.com`
4. Vercel will show you DNS records to add

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/johnmoore/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Media-Assets/income

# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Connect to GitHub (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/showscouthq.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# For future updates

```

---

## Future Deployments (Automatic!)

Once connected to Vercel:

1. Make changes locally
2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your update message"
   git push
   ```
3. Vercel automatically deploys! âœ¨

**No manual deployment needed!**

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Git not found"
Install git:
- Mac: `brew install git` or download from https://git-scm.com
- Already installed on most Macs

### "Permission denied (publickey)"
Use HTTPS instead of SSH:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/showscouthq.git
```

### "Build failed on Vercel"
1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Most common: Missing environment variables (that's OK for now)
3. The site should still deploy

### "Domain not working"
- DNS can take up to 24 hours (usually 10-60 minutes)
- Check DNS propagation: https://dnschecker.org
- Verify DNS records match Vercel's instructions
