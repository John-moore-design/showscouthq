## Next: Push to GitHub (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

Go to: **https://github.com/new**

Fill in:
- **Repository name:** `showscouthq`
- **Description:** "Ticket affiliate website for country and pop concerts"
- **Visibility:** Private (recommended for now)
- **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README" (we already have one)

Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Connect and Push

GitHub will show you commands. Copy your repository URL and run:

```bash
cd /Users/johnmoore/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/Media-Assets/income

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/showscouthq.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Your code is now on GitHub!** âœ…

## Then: Deploy to Vercel (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Sign Up for Vercel

Go to: **https://vercel.com/signup**

- Click "Continue with GitHub"
- Authorize Vercel to access your repositories

### Step 2: Import Your Project

1. Click **"Add New..."** â†’ **"Project"**
2. Find and select **`showscouthq`** repository
3. Vercel auto-detects Next.js settings âœ…
4. Click **"Deploy"**

Wait 2-3 minutes...

**Your site is LIVE!** ðŸŽ‰

You'll get a URL like: `https://showscouthq.vercel.app`

## Environment Variables (Add Later)

You can add these later when you have the keys:

In Vercel Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables:

```bash
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=
CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVERTKIT_FORM_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=
TICKET_NETWORK_AFFILIATE_ID=
VIVID_SEATS_AFFILIATE_ID=
STUBHUB_AFFILIATE_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://showscouthq.vercel.app
```

**Note:** The site works without these! Add them as you get them.

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Make changes and push updates
git add .
git commit -m "Your update message"
git push

# View remote URL
git remote -v
```

---

## What You'll Have After Deployment

âœ… Live website on Vercel  
âœ… Free `.vercel.app` domain  
âœ… Automatic HTTPS/SSL  
âœ… Global CDN (fast loading)  
âœ… Automatic deployments (push to GitHub = auto-deploy)  
âœ… Preview deployments for testing  

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied (publickey)"
Use HTTPS instead:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/showscouthq.git
```

### "Repository not found"
Make sure you:
1. Created the repository on GitHub
2. Replaced YOUR-USERNAME with your actual username
3. Made the repository accessible

### Build fails on Vercel
- Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Most common: Missing environment variables (that's OK!)
- The site should still deploy
